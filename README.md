# Mock-JS-Documentation-Page
Clone of a Freecodecamp project

Part of the Responsive Web Design course from Freecodecamp.

I had to make a clone of this page: https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks
Based off these requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page

Again, I didnt copy the code of the webpage, I did it on my own. I occasionally inspect elemented the
page if I got stuck or needed ideas on how to finish it.

I didnt finish the page because I didnt need to based on the project requirements. However, it would
be insanely easy to finish it. Id just have to add more nav elements and the rest of the body text.
